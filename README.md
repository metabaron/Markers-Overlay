Contributing

When to contribut? Please contact [me](https://github.com/metabaron) instead of forking the project.

Usage
-----
Read the code :)

If you want to try it on a real map, please update "android:apiKey" from "main.xml" with your Google Map API key
And comment "mapView.setVisibility(mapView.INVISIBLE);", line 63 from "Markers_OverlayActivity.java"

This is not the best possible code but it should work in almost any case and, mainly, should give you
an easy way to see how you can add text to an overlay on a Google Map.
